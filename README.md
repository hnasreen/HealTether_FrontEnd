# MERN Authentication App

A basic MERN stack application that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts with secure authentication, including functionalities for resetting forgotten passwords. The app uses **JWT** and **Bcrypt** for secure authentication, **React Redux** for state management with **Redux Toolkit**, and **MongoDB** as the data store. This project serves as a foundational authentication system in a full-stack app environment.
